# React Test

## Pre-requisite

- Sign up / login to https://codesandbox.io/.
- Form this sandbox using the "fork" button from the right side of the top bar.
- Use the forked sandbox to take the code test.

## Introduction

A boilerplate is provided with this sandbox, with initial setup, code and application structure, some already written code, and required dependencies.

You are free to change the structure and modify the code in any way you want. You can also add new dependencies to the application.

## The challenge

- Enable dark mode on the website (button, style is provided).
- Create a new page where the dark/light mode is in sync with the home page.
- It should be possible to navigate between both the pages.
- You should be able to save and clear the form. Use the second page to display the saved form data.

## Solution

- Your forked sandbox should have a unique URL. Send this URL when you are done with the test.
